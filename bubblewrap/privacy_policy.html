            <p><b>TL;DR:</b> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/">Steam</a> is used for
                some features.</p>

            <h2>Why is information collected?</h2>
            <p>To provide the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cloud saves</li>
                <li>Statistics</li>
                <li>Achievements</li>
                <li>Uploading and downloading of custom modifications (Mods)</li>
                <li>Contacting the developer</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is collected?</h2>
            <p>The game collects information through the third-party Steam. This
                includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your unique Steam user ID</li>
                <li>Details publicly available on your Steam profile.</li>
                <li>Information about achievements and statistics (for this game), and associated metadata.</li>
                <li>Subscribed items in Steam Workshop (for this game), and associated metadata.</li>
                <li>Playtime data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, this data is collected and sent to Steam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When uploading a Mod, all files associated with the Mod.</li>
                <li>When using cloud saves, all files associated with save data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Note:</i> Steam is a third-party not controlled by, or affiliated with me. Please read the
                <b><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/">Steam Privacy
                        Policy</a></b> for more
                for a complete explanation of how your data is used.
            </p>
            <p>If you contact the developer for any reason, your message and contact information is collected to respond
                to your request, enquiry, feedback, complaint, etc.</p>

            <h2>How is it used and disclosed?</h2>
            <p>When uploading a Mod to Steam Workshop, all files associated with the Mod are collected, uploaded and
                indefinitely stored on Steam servers. These files can be viewed, accessed, and downloaded by anyone.
                This also applies if you change, modify, update or edit a Mod. You may delete a Mod at any time through
                the Steam Workshop, but data may persist on servers for a time to fulfil legitimate
                purposes.
            </p>
            <p>Settings, configurations, and statistics are synchronized between devices using Steam Cloud. Files
                containing this information are uploaded and indefinitely stored on servers. This
                feature can be turned off by going in the 'properties' menu of the game's Steam library page.</p>
            <p>Personal information is not contained in Mod or Cloud Save files, within normal usage. Please do not edit
                the
                files to include any personal information. </p>
            <p>Your Steam ID is used in order to record statistics and achievements. No other
                account information is accessed.</p>
            <p>Contact details are not shared or disclosed, unless necessary to meet the purpose of your request,
                enquiry, feedback, complaint, etc.</p>

            <h2>Where is my information stored?</h2>
            <p>Data may be transferred between countries, and backed-up in data centers throughout the world.</p>
            <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy can be updated at any time, for any reason. If there are any material changes, a
                notice will be issued in the changelog, or another appropriate place. Please note that the Steam Privacy
                Policy may change at any time, independently to this one. </p>
