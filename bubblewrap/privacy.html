            <p><i>Notice:</i> This privacy policy is for the legacy Android version of Bubble Wrap. The new version
                (which has desktop support) has a <a href="privacy_policy.html"><b>different privacy policy</b></a>.</p>
            <h2 id="main_head">Bubble Wrap Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><i>Updated 25th August 2022</i>. Provided quote from Unity privacy policy, explicitly stating what data
                is collected.</p>

            <p>This page tells you how personal information is collected, used, shared and stored in the app "Bubble
                Wrap" by Donutask.</p>
            <p>The app uses the Unity game engine. Unfortunately, they inject this silly tracking stuff:</p>
            <blockquote>
                unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices); IP address;
                country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android,
                Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system
                and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of
                CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name;
                graphics card driver name and version
                (e.g., “nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71”); which graphics API is in use (e.g., “OpenGL 2.1” or “Direct3D 9.0c”);
                amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to
                create the game; sensor flags
                (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle
                identification (“app ID”) of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and
                Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad
                ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.

            <p>It is pointless to track people popping virtual bubbles, so I don't add further trackers.</p>
            <p>The Bubble Wrap settings are stored only on your device, they contain no personal information.</p>
            <p>The app contains no advertisements. This means no advertisers can track you in the app. This is also to
                increase realism as physical Bubble Wrap has no ads.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy can be updated at any time, for any reason. It is solely your responsibility to
                periodically re-read this policy so you are aware of how your personal data is treated.</p>
            <p>If there are any comments, questions or feedback about this Privacy Policy, please contact Donutask at <a
