                Thank you for installing Bread Dash (also referred to as the “app” or “game” from now on). You must read
                and agree to the terms below to play. Also read the privacy policy to know how your personal data is

            <p>
                You must not use this app to break laws or to hurt others. You must not use this app to create nuclear
                weapons. 3rd Parties Services by other companies that are outside my control are used in the game so I
                don't have to make something that has already
                been made. You also agree to their relevant terms. This includes, but not necessarily limited too, Unity
                Technologies ApS. You can find Unity’ss terms at
