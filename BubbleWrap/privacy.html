        <p>This page tells you how personal information is collected, used, shared and stored in the app "Bubble Wrap" by Donutask.</p>
        <p>The app uses the Unity game engine. Unity collects data like what device you install the app on and which country you installed it in. See their Privacy Policy at: <a href=https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policyhttps://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy>https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></p>
        <p>Except for Unity, there are no extra tracking or analytic technologies deliberately added to the app by the developer. This is because it is pointless to track people popping virtual bubbles.</p>
        <p>Some data is created when you change the Bubble Wrap settings. This information is not at all personally identifiable and is not sent anywhere</p>
        <p>The app contains no advertisements. This means no advertisers can track you in the app. This is also to increase realism as physical Bubble Wrap has no ads.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy can be updated at any time, for any reason. It is solely your responsibility to periodically re-read this policy so you are aware of how your personal data is treated.</p>
        <p>If there are any comments, questions or feedback about this Privacy Policy, please contact Donutask at <a href=mailto:thedonutask@gmail.com>thedonutask@gmail.com</a> </p>
